# What is it? 
  
  Open source ETL (Extract-Transform-Load) and script execution tool
  written in Java. Its primary focus is simplicity. It doesn't
  require the user to learn another complex XML-based language to
  use it, but allows the use of SQL or another scripting language
  suitable for the data source to perform required transformations.
